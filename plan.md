# Self Driving Car in GTAV
Control a self driving car using AI in GTAV ingame

## Steps
### 1. lane detection
1. - [x] detect lanes from images
2. - [x] detect lanes from video inputs
3. - [x] detect lanes from live video inputs

### 2. online game
1. - [x] find an online game to use to test -> slowroads.io
2. - [x] capture screen using python
3. - [x] control online game car using python
4. - [ ] control movement from editor to control online car game

### 3.apply AI
1. - [ ] learn/revise fundamentals
2. - [ ] learn relevant self driving stuff
3. - [ ] apply it on online game car

### 4. GTAV 
1. - [ ] capture data from gtaV
2. - [ ] control movement using editor
3. - [ ] apply above AI to gta
