# self-driving-slowroads
self driving on slowroad.io using a pid controller because it sounds really cool
detecting lanes, and controlling car on slowroads.io using python

to do:
- improve lane detector: sometimes goes crazy intertwining left and right (seems to work well for real life empty road videos, optimise for slowroads)
- adjust pid metrics: almost always ongoing
- add mpc controller: to see if its better than pid
